# Implementation Devlog
**Date:** 6.21.26  
Cloned Gemini onto local desktop, downloaded clingo, and troubleshooted Anaconda (issues running with my Windows Powershell, later switched to Anaconda Powershell and worked).

**Date:** 6.23.26  
Set up of 2020 environment (including installing python 3.7, clingo 5.4, numpy 1.19 and deap 1.3.1, all other dependencies limited to Python standard library or out of scope (untouched server/ node packages)) to  mimic original repository's execution state without modifications. Nothing in Gemini has been edited.

Environment:
- OS: Windows 11 (Windows PowerShell 5.1)
- Conda env: `gemini-2020`
- clingo: **5.4.0** (CLI; `--outf=2` JSON is consumed by `simulate.py`)
- Python: `3.7`
- numpy: `1.19` · deap: `1.3.1`
- Resolved env captured in: `environment-gemini-2020.yml`
- Run date: `6.23.26`
- Working dir: `asp/` (required `gemini.lp` resolves its `#include` relative to its own folder)
- Full console logs: `<path to the teed .log files>`

Commands (verbatim):
clingo generation/gemini.lp intents/dinner_intent.lp
python simulate.py temp 5 generation/gemini.lp intents/dinner_intent.lp 10 --project

Results:
| Command | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| `clingo …` | SATISFIABLE + ground facts | `Answer: 1` + full fact set → `SATISFIABLE` (~9.3 s total, 4.2 s solving) | green |
| `simulate.py …` | `temp_1.lp … temp_N.lp` | `JSON LOADED 10` → GA over `GAME 0…4` → `temp_1.lp … temp_5.lp` | green |

`JSON LOADED 10` confirms `simulate.py` parsed clingo 5.4.0's `--outf=2` JSON with no mismatch: the version-sensitive coupling between the solver output and the Python parser held on the period-correct clingo.

Benign output (NOT failures):
Logged so the raw console capture isn't misread as errors:
- `info: atom does not occur in any rule head` (×~20) - clingo **INFO**: atoms used in rule bodies but never derived in a head. Version-independent; not a breakage warning.
- `b'…generation\\generation.lp:264…'` - `simulate.py` echoing clingo's captured stderr (the INFO lines above) as a bytestring; its own debug print.
- `AFTERB …`, `(500,)`, `PLAYER CONTROLS …`, `GAME N` - `simulate.py`'s genetic-algorithm progress/debug output.

Observations (recorded, not fixed):
- **File count:** produced **5** files (`temp_1`–`temp_5`, one per `m=5`), not the "25" mentioned in `asp/README.md`. That README note ties the 25-file duplication to the ClimateChange project's `Coordinator.js`, so its absence here is expected and irrelevant to this project.
- **Non-determinism:** `simulate.py` uses `random` + DEAP with no fixed seed, so re-runs yield different games; outputs are not bit-reproducible across runs.

success!!

**Date:** 7.5.26

Started Stage B: bumping Python 3.7→3.9 first, holding clingo/numpy/deap at their 2020 baseline versions to isolate the axis. Isolation was done to ensure that if regression happened, I could pinpoint it on a specific dependency upgrade. Took three tries to get a valid environment, failures listed below, not code related:

1. `conda install -n <env> python=3.9` (no channel flag) silently failed to solve - `LibMambaUnsatisfiableError` on `numpy-base`, because it was resolving against the `defaults` channel only, not `conda-forge` where the original env's packages actually came from. A failed solve doesn't touch the env, so always re-check `python --version` after as I nearly treated a no-op as a successful bump.

2. Adding `-c conda-forge` still failed: the cloned env had leftover Python-3.7-specific builds (`pip`, `setuptools`, `wheel`, `wincertstore`, all `py37`-tagged) from the original `defaults`-channel install, and `conda install` won't proactively upgrade packages it wasn't asked to touch. Those pins made 3.9 unsatisfiable.

3. Fix: abandoned the clone for this hop and built a fresh env from scratch (`conda create -n gem-step1-py39 -c conda-forge python=3.9 numpy=1.19.5 deap=1.3.1 clingo=5.4.1 pip`), which resolved cleanly with no legacy ABI cruft.

Verified versions: `python 3.9.23, numpy 1.19.5, deap 1.3.1, clingo 5.4.1`

Smoke test: `clingo generation/gemini.lp intents/dinner_intent.lp` → `SATISFIABLE`, one model, same benign "atom does not occur in any rule head" grounding warnings as the 2020 baseline (pre-existing, unrelated to the version bump). Then `python simulate.py temp 5 generation/gemini.lp intents/dinner_intent.lp 10 project` ran to completion including clingo subprocess call, JSON parse, DEAP genetic-algorithm loop, and file write all succeeded for all 5 games, no tracebacks. No `typing` import failure, no DEAP `creator.create` reimport error, no clingo output-format issue observed.

Step 2: clingo 5.4.1→5.7.1, holding python=3.9, numpy=1.19.5, deap=1.3.1 from Step 1. Hit the missing-channel error a third time (`conda install -n gem-step1-py39 clingo=5.7` with no `-c conda-forge` → `PackagesNotFoundError`); fixed with `-c conda-forge` and it resolved cleanly since this was a clone-forward from an already-conda-forge-only env, no ABI conflicts this time.

Smoke test: `clingo generation/gemini.lp intents/dinner_intent.lp` → `SATISFIABLE`, same grounding warnings as baseline. `python simulate.py temp 5 generation/gemini.lp intents/dinner_intent.lp 10 --project` completed all 5 games, no errors.

**Notable, not a break:** solve time went from ~9-11s (clingo 5.4) to ~30s (clingo 5.7) on the identical `dinner_intent.lp` run. Likely noise between runs, as I reran when upgrading numpy and solve time went to ~15s (clingo and numpy are independent).

Step 3: numpy 1.19.5→1.26.4, holding python=3.9, clingo=5.7.1, deap=1.3.1. Clean solve (clingo alone doesn't exercise numpy, so this only confirms clingo/grounding still fine, expected, unrelated to this axis). `python simulate.py temp 5 generation/gemini.lp intents/dinner_intent.lp 10 --project` completed all 5 games, no errors. numpy 1.26.4 is the practical ceiling while deap stays at 1.3.1 (which pins numpy <2.0a0).

Step 4: deap 1.3.1→1.4.2. Could not reach deap 1.4.3/1.4.4 without a further Python bump: deap's newest releases have moved their own Python floor up, so "latest deap" and "stay on Python 3.9" are mutually exclusive right now.

Smoke test clean: `clingo generation/gemini.lp intents/dinner_intent.lp` → `SATISFIABLE`; `python simulate.py temp 5 generation/gemini.lp intents/dinner_intent.lp 10 --project` completed all 5 games, no tracebacks. Notably, the anticipated `creator.create` reimport error did not occur here.

**All four planned Stage B axes are now bumped and green**: Python 3.7→3.9, clingo 5.4→5.7.1, numpy 1.19.5→1.26.4, deap 1.3.1→1.4.2.
